## Dataset Information

In this study, we have developed a specialized sub-dataset (SUD-ROAD) derived from the [Santiago Urban Dataset (SUD)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423023448) . This new dataset exclusively focuses on the 'road' class. The characteristics of our tailored dataset are detailed in the following table:

| **Characteristic**      | **Description**       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Length**              | 1635 m               |
| **Classes**             | 7                    |
| **LiDAR sensor**        | MLS Riegl VUX-1HA    |
| **Number of Points**    | 57M                  |

### Manual Labeling
Manual labeling of the dataset was conducted using [CloudCompare](https://www.cloudcompare.org/). The dataset contains seven different classes:

1. Roads
2. Lane Lines
3. Road Markings
4. Manhole Covers
5. Drains
6. Cracks
7. Road Patching

In addition to the road, a total of 2,457 elements were manually segmented.
